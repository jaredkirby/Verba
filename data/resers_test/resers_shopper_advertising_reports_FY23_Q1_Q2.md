Benchmarks
None provided by the retailer for comparison.

Key Takeaways
- The campaign had a higher-than-estimated redemption rate of 4.62% compared to the anticipated 3%.
- Despite the higher redemption rate, the CPUM was high ($4.21), largely due to the low number of overall activations and higher coupon value.
- The ROAS was slightly above break-even at $1.14, indicating a small positive return on investment.

Recommendations
- Consider lowering the coupon value to reduce CPUM in future campaigns.
- Evaluate the efficacy of the campaign targeting, as the circulation did not reach the intended 15,000.
- Investigate additional ways to improve ROAS, possibly through in-store promotions or bundling strategies.

Summary
The campaign was moderately successful in terms of achieving a higher redemption rate than estimated. However, this came at the cost of a high CPUM, impacting the overall return on advertising spend (ROAS). Going forward, adjustments to the coupon value and targeting strategy may enhance campaign efficacy.
